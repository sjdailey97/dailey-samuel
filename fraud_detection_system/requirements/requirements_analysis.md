# Task 2: Requirements Analysis

## Functional Requirements:

The system should integrate with SecureBank’s core banking systems to access real-time transaction data and customer information.

The system should have flexible and customizable alert mechanisms to notify relevant stakeholders about flagged transactions.

The system should provide comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities to track performance metrics, monitor fraud trends, and optimize detection strategies over time.

The system should respect data minimization and purpose limitation principles, excluding data of customers who opt out.

The system should be capable of handling a significant volume of transactions daily.

## Non-Functional Requirements:

The system should adhere to data protection laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act.

The system should be capable of scaling to handle increased transaction volumes and the emergence of new fraud techniques.

The system should maintain a precision of ~40% and a recall of ~85%.

The system should reduce the frequency and severity of fraudulent transactions, leading to lower overall insurance claims for the insurance company.

The system should reduce the false positive rate, where legitimate transactions are incorrectly flagged as fraudulent.

## Here is the order:
The system should integrate with SecureBank’s core banking systems to access real-time transaction data and customer information: This is a fundamental requirement for the system to function and provide value. Without this integration, the system cannot analyze transactions for potential fraud.

The system should adhere to data protection laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or the California Consumer Privacy Act: Compliance with legal and regulatory standards is non-negotiable and must be ensured to avoid legal penalties and reputational damage.

The system should respect data minimization and purpose limitation principles, excluding data of customers who opt out: This is also a legal requirement related to privacy laws and regulations. It’s crucial to respect the privacy rights of customers.

The system should be capable of handling a significant volume of transactions daily: This requirement is critical for the system to be useful in a real-world banking environment where large volumes of transactions are processed daily.

The system should have flexible and customizable alert mechanisms to notify relevant stakeholders about flagged transactions: Timely alerts can help mitigate potential fraud. However, this requirement is ranked lower because it is more about optimizing the user experience rather than a fundamental functionality or compliance issue.

The system should provide comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities to track performance metrics, monitor fraud trends, and optimize detection strategies over time: While important for understanding and improving system performance, this requirement is not as immediately critical as the ones above.

The system should be capable of scaling to handle increased transaction volumes and the emergence of new fraud techniques: Scalability is important for future-proofing the system, but it is less immediately critical than the above requirements.

The system should maintain a precision of ~40% and a recall of ~85%: These are specific performance targets that the system should strive to meet. They are important for ensuring the effectiveness of the system, but they are not as critical as the functional, compliance, and capacity requirements above.

The system should reduce the frequency and severity of fraudulent transactions, leading to lower overall insurance claims for the insurance company: This is a desired outcome of the system, but it is dependent on the successful implementation of the above requirements.

The system should reduce the false positive rate, where legitimate transactions are incorrectly flagged as fraudulent: This is also a performance target. While it’s important for minimizing disruption to customers, it is less immediately critical than the other requirements.
