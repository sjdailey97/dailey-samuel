# Requirements Specification

Functional Requirement: Integration with SecureBank’s core banking systems

Explanation: The system needs to access real-time transaction data and customer information from SecureBank’s core banking systems. This is crucial for the system to analyze transactions for potential fraud.

Approach: This could be achieved through APIs provided by the core banking system. We would need to work closely with the bank’s IT team to understand the available APIs and how to use them.

Non-Functional Requirement: Adherence to data protection laws

Explanation: The system must comply with data protection laws such as GDPR or the California Consumer Privacy Act. This is non-negotiable to avoid legal penalties and reputational damage.

Approach: We would need to conduct a thorough review of these laws and ensure that our system design and data handling practices are compliant. This might involve encryption of sensitive data, anonymization techniques, and explicit consent mechanisms.

Functional Requirement: Data minimization and purpose limitation

Explanation: The system should exclude data of customers who opt out, respecting data minimization and purpose limitation principles. This is a legal requirement related to privacy laws and regulations.

Approach: We could implement a feature in the system that allows customers to opt out and ensures their data is not used in the fraud detection process. This might involve changes to the user interface and data storage systems.

Functional Requirement: Handling a significant volume of transactions daily

Explanation: The system needs to be capable of processing a large volume of transactions daily. This is critical for the system to be useful in a real-world banking environment.

Approach: This could be achieved through efficient algorithms and scalable infrastructure. We might consider using cloud-based solutions that can scale up or down based on demand.

Functional Requirement: Flexible and customizable alert mechanisms

Explanation: The system should have mechanisms to notify relevant stakeholders about flagged transactions. This is important for timely mitigation of potential fraud.

Approach: This could involve email notifications, dashboard alerts, or integration with other communication tools used by the bank. The alert settings could be made customizable to suit the needs of different stakeholders.

Functional Requirement: Comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities

Explanation: The system should provide capabilities to track performance metrics, monitor fraud trends, and optimize detection strategies over time. This is important for understanding and improving system performance.

Approach: This could involve building a dashboard with various metrics and visualizations. We might also consider using machine learning techniques to identify trends and optimize detection strategies.

Non-Functional Requirement: Scalability

Explanation: The system should be capable of scaling to handle increased transaction volumes and the emergence of new fraud techniques. This is important for future-proofing the system.

Approach: This could be achieved through cloud-based solutions and microservices architecture. We would also need to keep abreast of emerging fraud techniques and update our system accordingly.

Non-Functional Requirement: Precision and recall targets

Explanation: The system should maintain a precision of ~40% and a recall of ~85%. These are specific performance targets that the system should strive to meet.

Approach: This could be achieved through machine learning techniques and continuous model training and testing. We would need to regularly evaluate our system against these targets and make adjustments as necessary.

Non-Functional Requirement: Reduction in frequency and severity of fraudulent transactions

Explanation: The system should reduce the frequency and severity of fraudulent transactions, leading to lower overall insurance claims for the insurance company. This is a desired outcome of the system.

Approach: This would be a natural outcome of a successful fraud detection system. We would need to monitor insurance claims as a metric of our system’s success.

Non-Functional Requirement: Reduction in false positive rate

Explanation: The system should reduce the false positive rate, where legitimate transactions are incorrectly flagged as fraudulent. This is important for minimizing disruption to customers.

Approach: This could be achieved through machine learning techniques and continuous model training and testing. We would need to regularly evaluate our system’s false positive rate and make adjustments as necessary.
