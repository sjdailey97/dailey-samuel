# Task 4.1: Validation of Requirements with Stakeholders

## Stakeholder Interviews:
 Conduct one-on-one interviews with stakeholders to discuss the requirements in detail. This allows for a deep understanding of each requirement and its importance.

## Focus Groups:
Bring together a group of stakeholders to discuss and validate the requirements. This can help uncover any conflicting views or misunderstandings early in the process.
## Prototyping:
Develop a simplified model of the system or its parts to demonstrate the requirements. This allows stakeholders to see, interact with, and provide feedback on a tangible representation of the system.
## Review Meetings:
Regularly scheduled meetings with stakeholders to review the requirements and their progress can help ensure alignment and agreement.
## Surveys and Questionnaires:
These can be used to gather feedback from a larger group of stakeholders. They can be particularly useful when stakeholders are geographically dispersed.

# Task 4.2: Verification of Requirements Implementation

## Inspections and Reviews:
Regularly review the system and its documentation to ensure it aligns with the requirements. This can involve code reviews, design inspections, and document reviews.
## Testing:
Conduct various types of testing such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Each test verifies that different parts of the system meet the specified requirements.
## Traceability Matrix:
Create a traceability matrix that maps requirements to their corresponding implementation elements (like code modules or system components). This helps ensure that all requirements have been implemented and can be traced back to their source.
## Demonstrations:
Demonstrate the systemâ€™s functionality to the stakeholders. This allows them to see the implemented requirements in action and verify that they have been correctly implemented.
## Audits:
Conduct audits at various stages of the project to verify adherence to the requirements. This could involve internal team audits or external audits by an independent party.
